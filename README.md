🎷Music Store Data Analysis Project Using SQL!🎧🎧
 
 Hello everyone,
 
📌Project Description📌
🎯This project will show you how to analyze the digital TuneTracker music store database.
🎯I have examined the dataset with SQL and helped the store understand its business growth by answering simple and complex
questions based on geographical growth, purchase power, total revenue, genre
performance, music band popularity, best city in terms of revenue and best
customer in terms of purchase rate.
🎯This analysis will provide great insight to the stakeholders to take right and effective decisions.
 
📌Key findings:
🎯Recognizing the most tenured employee within their job title highlights dedicated team members.
🎯Uncovering high-invoice generating countries informs strategic market focus and growth opportunities.
🎯Pinpointing the highest-spending customer, prime invoice city, and leading rock bands assists in tailored promotions and playlist selection.
🎯Analyzing customer expenditures and preferred music genres by country optimizes marketing strategies and stock
management.
